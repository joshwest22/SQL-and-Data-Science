<h3 id="innerJoin">How does inner join work?</h3>
    <span>This is used to join matching values in both tables. The syntax is as follows: <div id="example"><pre>
        SELECT column_name(s)
        FROM table1
        INNER JOIN table2
        ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;</pre></div>Inner Join works by selecting the column or columns that are wished to be incorporated, then the FROM statement makes sure that the any table1 data that present in the other data (e.g. table2) is shown.The INNER JOIN statement then joins specified overlapping data (e.g. column_nam) from table2 to table1.
        <span>This JOIN method is very useful as it allows from the easy comparison between common elements in multiple data tables in an SQL database.</span>

<h3>What is a data scientist? How is it comparable and different from a computer scientist?</h3>
    <div>
    <p>A data scientist is someone who looks for meaning or knowledge in the data. This includes data visualization techniques (such as exploratory data analysis) and algorithm usage. Data scientists are given an enormous data set (i.e. Big Data) and a question to answer. Data scientists are not just programmers, but some programmers are data scientists. Data scientists hypothesize what they think is important, but rather than just running with what they think they will use the data to determine whether their hypothesis was correct. Data scientists must be the intersection of a programmer and a business intelligence officer. That is to say, they must have the technical skill and algorithmic knowledge of a programmer, but the business knowledge of one in business intelligence. Additionally, it should be noted that data scientist are most useful when the data is given to them in context and when data munging and organization can be done largely for them, as their expertise is largely in analysis and there are other positions that could be organizes and cleaning data.</p>
